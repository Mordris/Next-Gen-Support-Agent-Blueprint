# Next-Gen Support Agent Blueprint

> **Note:** This project is currently under active development. The code is in a pre-alpha state and is subject to frequent changes. Full setup and run instructions will be added once the initial services are stable.

Welcome to the repository for the **Next-Gen Support Agent Blueprint**. This project documents the end-to-end process of building a state-of-the-art, full-stack AI customer support agent.

The goal of this repository is to provide a production-ready, reusable blueprint for creating sophisticated AI applications that are accurate, scalable, and user-friendly.

## Planned Architecture & Features

The final application will be a complete, containerized system featuring:

- **🤖 An Advanced AI Agent:** A core reasoning engine built with LangChain that can use multiple tools, manage conversational memory, and handle complex queries.
- **📚 A State-of-the-Art RAG Pipeline:** A retrieval system enhanced with a **re-ranking** step to ensure the agent has access to the most accurate and relevant information.
- **⚡ A Production-Grade Backend:** A scalable, asynchronous **FastAPI** server that provides a real-time, token-by-token streaming API using Server-Sent Events.
- **🧠 Persistent & Scalable Memory:** A **Redis**-backed memory store to manage multi-user conversations robustly.
- **🖥️ An Interactive User Interface:** A **Streamlit** front-end that provides a clean, user-friendly chat experience and visualizes the agent's real-time thoughts and tool usage.
- **💰 Cost & Performance Optimization:** A hybrid LLM approach that uses smaller, faster models for simple tasks to reduce latency and operational costs.
- **🛡️ Safety & Improvement Guardrails:** A system for detecting and blocking harmful inputs, along with a user feedback mechanism for continuous improvement.
- **🐳 Fully Containerized:** The entire multi-service application will be managed and deployed with **Docker and Docker Compose**.
